# TODO

Examples for requests. That's a lot of work.
Parsing body, notably as an external file.
Sequence, somehow
Why the hell is primevue/menuitem not cached by Deno?

backend:
  - Contexts
  - Sweet mother of god, fix the design pattern in serve.ts
    - Add workspace entity for Get, and some command to get all workspaces
  - Create auth UI for bulk edit and creation
  - Cookie jar
  - Redo Hooks so it's not only file-based
  - find xmlStringify

Frontend:
  - Contexts
  - Scopes
  - form-* Body
  - binary Body
  - Settings tab

### Bonus

- TUI
- Determine parser based on the supplied content-type header instead of having to do extension?
- Where should we write to for Postman Store?
- More Stores & parsers; TOML, SQLite
- GET Image
- Tooltip over variables to show their resolved values


### Polish
- Expand & Collapse All
- Remove in all tables
- Remove in accordions
